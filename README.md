# Slidedown Syntax Definition

This is a [Vim][0] syntax file for the [Slidedown][1] presentation
software. It requires a Markdown syntax file be installed. I use [this
one][2], but it shouldn't matter too much as long as the syntax is named
'markdown'.

All this really does is add highlighting for `!SLIDE` and `@@@`
sections. More coming if there is desire. File an issue [on GitHub][3]
if there's something you need.
